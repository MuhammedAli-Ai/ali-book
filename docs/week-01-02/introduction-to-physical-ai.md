# Introduction to Physical AI

**Physical AI** refers to the synthesis of Artificial Intelligence (AI) with physical systems, enabling machines not just to think (like ChatGPT) but to act and interact with the physical world. It is the bridge between the **Digital Brain** and the **Physical Body**.

## What is Embodied Intelligence?

Embodied intelligence allows agents to learn and solve problems through interactions with their environment. Unlike disembodied AI (which lives on servers), physical AI systems must deal with:

- **Gravity & Physics**: The laws of the physical world.
- **Uncertainty**: Noisy sensors and unpredictable environments.
- **Real-time Constraints**: Decisions must be made in milliseconds.

> [!NOTE]
> **The Moravec's Paradox**
> It is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility.

## The Three Pillars of Physical AI

1.  **Perception (The Eyes & Ears)**
    - Understanding the environment using sensors (Cameras, LiDAR, IMUs).
    - Techniques: Computer Vision, SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping).

2.  **Cognition (The Brain)**
    - Planning, reasoning, and decision making.
    - Techniques: Path planning (A*), Reinforcement Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs).

3.  **Actuation (The Muscles)**
    - Executing commands to move motors and joints.
    - Techniques: PID Control, Inverse Kinematics, Torque Control.

## Why Humanoids?

Humanoid robots are designed to operate in environments built for humans.

- **Stairs & Doorways**: Legs can navigate terrain that wheels cannot.
- **Tools & Objects**: Hands can manipulate tools designed for human hands.
- **Social Interaction**: A human-like form facilitates better communication and trust.

## The Future of Work

We are entering an era of **Agentic AI**—software that can take action. When given a physical body, these agents become robots capable of performing labor, caregiving, and exploration.

### Key Skills You Will Learn
- **ROS 2**: The standard middleware for robotics.
- **Simulation**: Using Gazebo and NVIDIA Isaac Sim.
- **AI Integration**: Connecting LLMs to robot actions (VLA).

## Next Steps

In the next chapter, we will explore the **Sensor Systems** that give robots their senses.
