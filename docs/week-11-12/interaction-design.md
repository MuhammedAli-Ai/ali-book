# Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)

Designing humanoids isn't just about physics; it's about psychology. If a robot looks friendly but moves unpredictably, it causes fear (Uncanny Valley).

## Safety First

1.  **Passive Safety**: Soft materials, lightweight limbs.
2.  **Active Safety**: Collision detection (stopping when hitting something).
    - *Impedance Control*: Making the robot behave like a spring rather than a stiff rock.

## Non-Verbal Communication

- **Gaze**: The robot should "look" at what it is attending to (or look at the user).
- **Proximation**: Respecting personal space.
- **Gestures**: Pointing or waving to indicate intent.

## The LED Ring

Many robusts (like Unitree Go2) use LED patterns to signal state:
- **Blue**: Idle / Listening.
- **Red**: Error / Low Battery.
- **Spinning**: Processing.
