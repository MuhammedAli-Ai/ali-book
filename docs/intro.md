# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** textbook. This course bridges the gap between the digital brain (AI) and the physical body (Robots).

## Course Overview

This textbook is designed to take you from the foundations of embodied intelligence to building autonomous humanoid robots powered by modern AI.

### Core Modules

#### [Module 1: Intro to Physical AI](./week-01-02/introduction-to-physical-ai)
Understand the landscape of Physical AI and the sensors that allow machines to perceive the world.

#### [Module 2: ROS 2 Fundamentals](./week-03-05/ros2-architecture)
Master the Robotic Operating System (ROS 2), the nervous system of modern robots.

#### [Module 3: Robot Simulation](./week-06-07/gazebo-setup)
Create digital twins using Gazebo and Unity to train robots safely in virtual worlds.

#### [Module 4: NVIDIA Isaac Platform](./week-08-10/isaac-sdk)
Leverage NVIDIA's advanced simulation and AI tools for high-performance robotics.

#### [Module 5: Humanoid Development](./week-11-12/bipedal-locomotion)
Tackle the challenges of bipedal locomotion, manipulation, and human-like interaction.

#### [Module 6: Conversational Robotics](./week-13/conversational-robotics)
Integrate Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models to give robots a voice and cognitive reasoning.

## Getting Started

1. Check the [Hardware Requirements](./hardware/workstation-requirements) to set up your lab.
2. Begin with [Introduction to Physical AI](./week-01-02/introduction-to-physical-ai).
3. Use the **RAG Chatbot** (coming soon) to ask questions about the content.

## About this Course

This course is part of the **Panaversity** curriculum, preparing students for the future of work where humans collaborate with intelligent agents and robots.
